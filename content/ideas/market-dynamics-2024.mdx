## Investment Risks

**Cord-Cutting Acceleration**: Traditional TV networks face continued subscriber losses, pressuring linear advertising revenue.

**Streaming Competition**: Intense competition from Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and emerging platforms creates content cost inflation and subscriber acquisition challenges.

**Economic Sensitivity**: Theme parks and consumer products segments remain vulnerable to economic downturns and consumer spending shifts.

## Valuation Assessment

At current levels, Disney trades at approximately 15x forward earnings, representing a discount to its historical average of 18-20x. This compression reflects market skepticism about streaming profitability timelines.

<Callout type="success" title="Investment Opportunity">
The current valuation provides an attractive entry point for investors betting on Disney's execution of its streaming strategy and continued parks excellence.
</Callout>

## Price Target & Recommendation

**Rating**: BUY  
**Price Target**: $135 (12-month target)  
**Current Price**: ~$119

The target reflects a multiple expansion as streaming losses narrow and parks business maintains strong growth trajectory.
