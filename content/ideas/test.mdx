</Callout>

**Investment Committee**: The board includes experienced business leaders and investors who understand Berkshire's culture and philosophy.

## Valuation Considerations

### Book Value Analysis

Berkshire has historically traded around 1.2-1.5x book value, though this metric becomes less relevant as the equity portfolio grows relative to operating businesses.

### Sum-of-Parts Analysis

Breaking down Berkshire's value components:
- Public equity portfolio: ~$365B
- Operating businesses: ~$200B estimated value
- Cash and equivalents: ~$167B

### Intrinsic Value Assessment

<Callout type="info" title="Valuation Approach">
Berkshire's intrinsic value should reflect both current portfolio value and the premium for superior capital allocation capabilities.
</Callout>

## Investment Risks

**Concentration Risk**: Apple represents nearly 50% of the equity portfolio, creating single-stock concentration risk.

**Scale Challenges**: Berkshire's enormous size limits investment opportunities and may reduce future return potential.

**Economic Sensitivity**: Operating businesses face cyclical pressures during economic downturns.

## Long-Term Investment Case

Berkshire represents a unique opportunity to invest alongside one of history's greatest capital allocators while gaining exposure to a diversified collection of high-quality businesses.

## Price Target & Recommendation

**Rating**: BUY  
**Price Target**: $485 (12-month target for Class B shares)  
**Current Price**: ~$466

The target reflects modest appreciation as the company continues steady capital allocation and business growth.
