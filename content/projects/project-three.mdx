## Architecture Decisions

### React Router v7
Chose the latest React Router for its improved SSR capabilities, better type safety, and modern development patterns.

### MDX Integration
MDX provides the perfect balance between Markdown simplicity and React component flexibility for technical content.

### Three.js & React Three Fiber
Implemented 3D elements to create engaging visual experiences while maintaining performance through careful optimization.

### Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS framework enables rapid development and consistent design while keeping bundle sizes minimal.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 3D Performance
Optimizing Three.js performance required implementing level-of-detail systems, efficient asset loading, and careful memory management to maintain 60fps across devices.

### SSR with 3D Content
Handling server-side rendering with client-side 3D content required careful component hydration strategies and graceful fallbacks.

### Content Workflow
Creating an efficient content authoring workflow involved building custom MDX components and establishing clear content patterns for maintainability.

### Build Optimization
Achieving fast build times while supporting complex features required careful Vite configuration and strategic code splitting.
