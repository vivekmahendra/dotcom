# Building a Personal Website in 2024: Lessons Learned

After years of having a simple single-page site, I finally bit the bullet and built a proper personal website from scratch. Here are my thoughts on the process and what I learned along the way.

## Why Rebuild?

My old site was a basic HTML/CSS page that I hadn't updated in years. As I started writing more about investing and building side projects, I needed:

- **Better content management** - Easy way to publish articles
- **Professional presentation** - Clean, modern design
- **Performance** - Fast loading and good SEO
- **Flexibility** - Easy to iterate and add features

## Technology Stack

After evaluating several options, I landed on:

### Frontend Framework
**React Router v7** - The new file-based routing and TypeScript support won me over. Coming from Next.js background, the conventions felt familiar.

### Styling
**Tailwind CSS** - I was initially skeptical, but the utility-first approach has grown on me. The productivity gains are real once you get past the learning curve.

### Content Management
**MDX** - Perfect for technical writing. I can embed React components directly in markdown, which opens up lots of possibilities for interactive content.

### Hosting
**Vercel** - Zero-config deployments and excellent performance. The integration with Git workflows is seamless.

## Design Philosophy

I wanted something clean and minimal that wouldn't distract from the content:

### Typography-First
Heavy emphasis on readable typography. I spent way too much time fine-tuning font sizes, line heights, and spacing.

### Content Structure
- **Ideas** - Investment analysis and market insights
- **Projects** - Side projects and experiments  
- **Blog** - General thoughts on tech and business
- **About** - Personal background and interests

### Interactive Elements
Added some subtle animations and 3D elements to make it feel modern without being overwhelming.

## Challenges Faced

### Content Organization
Figuring out how to categorize content was harder than expected. The line between "ideas" (investment content) and "blog" (general thoughts) isn't always clear.

### SEO Optimization
Getting meta tags, structured data, and page performance right took more effort than anticipated. The React ecosystem has good tools, but it requires intentional setup.

### Design Consistency
Maintaining visual consistency across different content types while keeping each section feeling distinct was a balancing act.

## What Went Well

### Development Experience
The modern React tooling made development enjoyable. Hot reloading, TypeScript integration, and component-driven development felt smooth.

### Performance
Achieved excellent Lighthouse scores with minimal optimization effort. Modern frameworks handle a lot of performance concerns out of the box.

### Content Creation Workflow
Writing in MDX feels natural. The ability to embed components like charts and callouts directly in content is powerful.

## What I'd Do Differently

### Start with a Design System
I built components as needed, but starting with a proper design system would have saved time and improved consistency.

### Content Strategy First
I should have planned the content structure more thoroughly before building. Some architectural decisions were harder to change later.

### Analytics from Day One
Adding analytics and performance monitoring early would have helped guide optimization efforts.

## Key Takeaways

### Modern Web Development is Great
The developer experience in 2024 is fantastic. The tooling is mature, deployment is simple, and performance is good by default.

### Content is King
No amount of fancy technology matters if the content isn't valuable. Focus on creating useful content first, optimize the experience second.

### Iterate Continuously
A personal website is never "done." It's a living project that evolves with your interests and skills.

## What's Next?

Some features I'm planning to add:

- **Search functionality** - Help visitors find relevant content
- **Performance tracking** - Show how investment ideas have performed over time
- **Interactive charts** - Better data visualization for analysis posts
- **Newsletter integration** - Build an email list for regular updates

## Tools and Resources

Here are some tools that made the process smoother:

- **Figma** - For design mockups and component libraries
- **GitHub Copilot** - Surprisingly helpful for boilerplate code
- **Lighthouse** - Essential for performance optimization
- **Real Favicon Generator** - Saved time on favicon creation

Building a personal website in 2024 is both easier and harder than it used to be. The tools are more powerful, but the expectations are higher. The key is finding the right balance between functionality and simplicity.
